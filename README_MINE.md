#README.md will explain the files and how they are used

##There are 5 R script files.

1. setup.R - call this script first to read in the data and to calculate all important fields for the plot
2. plot1.R - generates the plot for the Global Active Power frequency and saves it to "plot1.png"
3. plot2.R - generates the plot for the Global Active Power by date and time and saves it to "plot2.png"
4. plot3.R - generates the plot for the Energy Sub Metering and saves it to "plot3.png"
5. plot4.R - generates the group of plots for Global Active Power, Voltage, Energy Sub metering, and Global Relative power and saves it to "plot4.R"


##The png files are described above and contain plots from the above R scripts based on the parameters in the assignment

Note: The download and unzip process was not included as part of the set up script. Visit https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip to get the data, and see the original source for documentation: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
